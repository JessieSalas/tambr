"Specifcally we focus on novels and generate music that captures the change in the distribution of emotion words"

**DIFFERENTIATORS**
Use more instruments other than just piano
    Full orchestra?
    Electronic synth?

    Would be taken more seriously if use full orchestra maybe?
    Is orchestra more legit?
    Piano is simple and versatile, that's why the first people used it

Benefits of more instruments:
 More versatile soundscape
 Can sound more real

Use better VSTs for generating the sound
=> More realistic sounding instruments

You gotta stick a convolutional neural network in there somewhere
Examples of music?

TransProse:
    They are hella basic.
    like easy basic

-----------
other names
bach 2
neuro

mozart
music information retrieval

get info about neural network composition
story telling in machine learning

first you need to collect some statistics about good music

deepdream music

you can make music video with deep dream

we don't want to just compose new music
we want to convert book into music

a persons perception of book 
what would that sound like

pitches need to be controlled by words
books are not random, and have natural distributions
part of speech etc

need to use synths where timbre is controleld by something
grittyness is density
translation of metaphors
translation

full orchestra

outer lands synth is good for ewi

you could synthesize with logic like match instrument name to 
emotion like you assign a tagged synth "comic sunrise" and that's it 
use google word2vec to generate similar stuff you know

piano is more "legit" or also full orchestra is more "legit"
like in terms of traditional music sounds

if you pick a synth, it might get labeled as to hobbyist 
some people have certain conceptions of electronic music

maybe the kind of people who would be interested in this nerdy thing would
like the traditional 

or do you think the kind of people interested in this would be into th e
nerdy weird?

I think nerdy weird, if you can pull it off

many people play piano piano is versatile instrument

full synth orchestra

drums are good if you can pull it off
kind of like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EWz0lyQLX8 time
by inception with drum, piano, and synth and orchestra
