Need to know how long the song will be
    some sort of function of how long the book is

Will separate it into sections.
For example, 1984 will have 3 songs since there are 3 parts

Want to capture the conflicing alternating chapters of grapes of wrath

Those are subtle things that matter

quiter is sadder
slower is sadder
lower is sadder

more polarity is more simultaneous notes, larger absolute value 

more rhythmic change is happier

lognormal

There is a ranking for intervals dissonance is sadness
